## 🎯 Why This Project?

Most Data Mesh resources focus on **theory**. This toolkit provides **practical, production-ready templates and tools** to actually implement Data Mesh on Azure.

Built by a data architect with 18+ years of experience building enterprise data platforms serving 500+ users.

## 🚀 What's Included

### Currently Building (Q1 2026):
- **Domain Data Product Templates** - Standardized structure for creating data products
- **Self-Service Platform Tools** - CLI and automation for domain teams  
- **Federated Governance Framework** - Automated policy enforcement
- **Azure Reference Architectures** - Proven patterns for Azure implementation

## 📊 Project Status

🚧 **Under Active Development** - MVP launching March 2026

**Development roadmap:**
Foundation & research 
Domain data product templates 
Self-service platform tools 
Governance framework 


## 🎓 The Problem We're Solving

Traditional centralized data platforms struggle with:
- ❌ Bottlenecks in centralized data teams
- ❌ Lack of domain ownership
- ❌ Slow time-to-value for data consumers
- ❌ Scaling challenges with growing data needs

**Data Mesh offers a solution, but implementation is hard.**

This toolkit bridges the gap between Data Mesh theory and Azure practice.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

Based on Zhamak Dehghani's four foundational pillars:

1. **Domain-oriented decentralized data ownership** - Data owned by domain teams who understand it best
2. **Data as a product** - Treating data with product thinking (quality, SLAs, discoverability)
3. **Self-serve data infrastructure as a platform** - Enable domain autonomy without requiring deep infrastructure expertise
4. **Federated computational governance** - Automated policies, not manual processes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure
  - Azure Synapse Analytics
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Azure Purview (for data governance)
  - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- **Languages:** Python, YAML, Bicep (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Tools:** Azure CLI, Git, GitHub Actions

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project stands on the shoulders of:
- **Zhamak Dehghani** - For pioneering the Data Mesh concept
- **The data engineering community** - For pushing architecture evolution
- **Real-world challenges** - From managing enterprise data platforms at scale

## 💡 Inspiration

Born from the gap between Data Mesh theory and practical implementation. After building and managing enterprise data lakes serving 500+ users, I've seen firsthand the challenges of centralized architectures. 
This toolkit aims to make Data Mesh adoption practical and achievable.
